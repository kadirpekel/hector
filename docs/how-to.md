# How To Guides

Practical, step-by-step guides for building with Hector. From basic setups to advanced integrations.

## üöÄ Tutorial Guides

### [AI Coding Assistant Tutorial](how-to/TUTORIAL_CURSOR)
Create a powerful Cursor-like AI coding assistant with semantic search and chain-of-thought reasoning‚Äîall in pure YAML.

**What you'll learn:**
- Setting up your first Hector agent
- Configuring LLM providers
- Adding document stores for RAG
- Implementing chain-of-thought reasoning
- Building a complete coding assistant

## üî• Advanced Examples

### [LangChain vs Hector Multi-Agent System](architecture-design/TUTORIAL_MULTI_AGENT)
See how Hector transforms complex LangChain multi-agent implementations into simple YAML configuration.

**What you'll learn:**
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Supervisor agent configuration
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Task decomposition and synthesis
- Comparing Hector vs traditional frameworks

**Impact:** 500+ lines Python ‚Üí 120 lines YAML with same functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Guides

### [Custom MCP Tools](how-to/MCP_CUSTOM_TOOLS)
Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to extend Hector's capabilities with external services and APIs.

**What you'll learn:**
- Setting up MCP servers
- Configuring MCP tools in Hector
- Building custom MCP integrations
- Connecting to external APIs
- Tool discovery and management

## üìö Learning Paths

### For Beginners
1. Start with [Getting Started](../getting-started/QUICK_START) - Installation and setup
2. Learn about [Building Agents](../agent-capabilities/intelligence-reasoning) in Agent Capabilities
3. Follow [AI Coding Assistant Tutorial](how-to/TUTORIAL_CURSOR) tutorial
4. Explore [Tools & Actions](../agent-capabilities/tools-actions)

### For Experienced Developers
1. Review [Agent Capabilities](../agent-capabilities) - Essential concepts
2. Compare approaches with [LangChain vs Hector](architecture-design/TUTORIAL_MULTI_AGENT)
3. Dive into [Custom MCP Tools](how-to/MCP_CUSTOM_TOOLS)
4. Explore [Advanced Architecture](../architecture-design/ARCHITECTURE)

### For Production Deployments
1. Review [Architecture & Design](../architecture-design) - Production patterns
2. Configure [Authentication](../agent-capabilities/production-security/authentication) setup
3. Set up [Memory Management](../agent-capabilities/memory-context) setup
4. Configure [External Agents](../agent-capabilities/multi-agent-systems/external-agents)
5. Reference [API Documentation](../reference/API_REFERENCE)
