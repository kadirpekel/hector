# Agent Capabilities

Discover what Hector agents can do, organized by capability. Each section covers specific features that make your agents powerful and intelligent.

## üß† Intelligence & Reasoning

How agents think, reason, and make decisions.

- **[Prompt Customization](intelligence-reasoning/prompt-customization)** - Fine-tune agent behavior with slot-based prompts
- **[Reasoning Strategies](intelligence-reasoning/reasoning-strategies)** - Chain-of-thought vs supervisor reasoning
- **[Advanced Reasoning](intelligence-reasoning/advanced-reasoning)** - Reflection, verification, and goal extraction

## üíæ Memory & Context

How agents remember and manage context.

- **[Working Memory](memory-context/working-memory)** - Session-scoped conversation context
- **[Long-term Memory](memory-context/long-term-memory)** - Persistent knowledge with vector storage
- **[Memory Configuration](memory-context/memory-configuration)** - Advanced tuning and strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Actions

What agents can do beyond language generation.

- **[Built-in Tools](tools-actions/built-in-tools)** - 5 ready-to-use tools for common tasks
- **[MCP Integration](tools-actions/mcp-integration)** - Connect to 150+ external tools
- **[Custom Tools](tools-actions/custom-tools)** - Build custom capabilities via gRPC

## üìö Knowledge & RAG

How agents access and use knowledge.

- **[Document Stores](knowledge-rag/document-stores)** - Semantic search and RAG setup
- **[Knowledge Management](knowledge-rag/knowledge-management)** - Organizing and retrieving information

## üì§ Output & Communication

How agents respond and communicate.

- **[Structured Output](output-communication/structured-output)** - Reliable JSON/XML/Enum responses
- **[Sessions & Streaming](output-communication/sessions-streaming)** - Multi-turn conversations and real-time output

## üîó Multi-Agent Systems

How agents work together.

- **[External Agents](multi-agent-systems/external-agents)** - Integrate remote A2A agents
- **[Agent Orchestration](multi-agent-systems/agent-orchestration)** - Coordinate multiple agents

## üîí Production & Security

Production-ready features and security.

- **[Authentication](production-security/authentication)** - JWT security for production
- **[Security & Sandboxing](production-security/security-sandboxing)** - Safe execution and isolation

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Intelligence** - Learn how agents think and reason
2. **Add Capabilities** - Give agents tools and knowledge
3. **Enable Memory** - Help agents remember context
4. **Configure Output** - Control how agents respond
5. **Scale Up** - Build multi-agent systems
6. **Deploy Securely** - Production-ready security

This organization makes it easy to find exactly what you need to build powerful, intelligent agents.
