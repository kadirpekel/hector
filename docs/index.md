<div class="hero-intro">
  <p>Deploy observable, secure, and scalable AI agent systems with hot reload, distributed configuration, and A2A-native federation. All configured in YAML.</p>

  <p>Built for real-world complexity: orchestrate multiple specialized agents, equip them with advanced reasoning strategies like chain-of-thought and tree search, give them long-term memory with RAG and vector stores, connect them to any tool or API, and stream responses in real-time. All while maintaining production-grade observability and security.</p>

## Key Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :zap: __Zero-Code Configuration__

    Pure YAML agent definition. No Python/Go required—define sophisticated agents declaratively.

-   :chart_with_upwards_trend: __Production Observability__

    Built-in Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing. Monitor latency, token usage, costs, and errors.

-   :shield: __Security-First__

    JWT auth, RBAC, and command sandboxing out of the box. Production-grade security controls.

-   :arrows_counterclockwise: __Hot Reload__

    Update configurations without downtime. Reload from Consul/Etcd/ZooKeeper automatically.

-   :link: __A2A Protocol Native__

    Standards-compliant agent communication and federation for distributed, interoperable deployments.

-   :rocket: __Resource Efficient__

    Single 30MB binary, <100ms startup. 10-20x less resource usage than Python frameworks.
