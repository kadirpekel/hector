# Knowledge & RAG

Enable your agents to access and use knowledge through document stores and semantic search.

## Core Features

- **[Document Stores](document-stores)** - Semantic search and RAG setup
- **[Knowledge Management](knowledge-management)** - Organizing and retrieving information

## Quick Start

1. **Set up Document Stores** - Configure vector storage for your knowledge
2. **Enable RAG** - Agents can search and use your documents
3. **Organize Knowledge** - Structure information for optimal retrieval

## Key Concepts

- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information by meaning, not keywords
- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate responses
- **Vector Storage**: Efficient similarity search

This section covers how agents access knowledge - essential for accurate, informed responses.
