# Memory & Context

Enable your agents to remember conversations, learn from interactions, and maintain context across sessions.

## Core Features

- **[Working Memory](agent-capabilities/memory-context/working-memory)** - Session-scoped conversation context
- **[Long-term Memory](agent-capabilities/memory-context/long-term-memory)** - Persistent knowledge with vector storage
- **[Memory Configuration](agent-capabilities/memory-context/memory-configuration)** - Advanced tuning and strategies

## Quick Start

1. **Enable Working Memory** - Agents remember the current conversation
2. **Add Long-term Memory** - Agents learn and remember across sessions
3. **Configure Strategies** - Fine-tune memory behavior for your use case

## Key Concepts

- **Dual-layer Architecture**: Working memory + long-term memory
- **Automatic Management**: Smart context window management
- **Vector Storage**: Semantic search and retrieval

This section covers how agents remember and learn - essential for intelligent, context-aware interactions.
