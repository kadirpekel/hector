# Getting Started

New to Hector? Start here! These guides will get you up and running quickly.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Zero-Config Mode](ZERO_CONFIG_MODE)** - Start instantly without any configuration! üöÄ
- **[Quick Start](QUICK_START)** - Install and run your first agent in 5 minutes
- **[CLI Guide](CLI_GUIDE)** - Master the command-line interface
- **[Your First Agent](AGENTS#your-first-agent)** - Build a custom agent step-by-step
- **[Basic Configuration](CONFIGURATION#basic-setup)** - Essential configuration options

## Two Ways to Start

### ‚ö° Fastest: Zero-Config Mode

No configuration file needed!

```bash
# Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Start using immediately
hector call assistant "Explain quantum computing"
hector chat assistant
```

**Perfect for:**
- Quick experimentation
- Learning Hector
- Simple use cases
- CI/CD integration

**[‚Üí See Zero-Config Mode Guide](ZERO_CONFIG_MODE)**

### üìù Full Configuration

Create a `hector.yaml` for advanced features:

```yaml
agents:
  assistant:
    name: "My Assistant"
    llm: "gpt-4o"
    prompt:
      system_role: "You are a helpful assistant"

llms:
  gpt-4o:
    type: "openai"
    model: "gpt-4o-mini"
    api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```

**Unlocks:**
- Custom prompts
- Multiple agents
- RAG (document stores)
- Advanced memory
- Multi-agent orchestration

**[‚Üí See Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START)**

## Dual-Mode Architecture

Hector has two modes of operation:

### üöÄ Direct Mode (Default)

Agent runs in-process - no server needed.

```bash
hector call assistant "hello"
hector chat assistant
```

### üåê Server Mode

Runs A2A protocol server for multi-agent systems.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
hector serve

# Terminal 2: Connect
hector call assistant "hello" --server http://localhost:8080
```

**[‚Üí See CLI Guide](CLI_GUIDE) for complete documentation**
