# Architecture & Design

Deep dive into Hector's architecture, design patterns, and how it compares to other AI agent frameworks.

## System Architecture

- **[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE)** - System design, components, and patterns
- **[A2A Native Architecture](A2A_NATIVE_ARCHITECTURE)** - Technical comparison: Hector vs LangChain/LangGraph A2A implementations

## Design Patterns & Comparisons

- **[LangChain vs Hector Multi-Agent System](TUTORIAL_MULTI_AGENT)** - See how Hector transforms complex LangChain multi-agent implementations into simple YAML configuration

## Key Concepts

- **A2A Protocol Compliance** - Built on industry-standard Agent-to-Agent protocol
- **Declarative Configuration** - Pure YAML instead of Python code
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - LLM-driven agent selection and delegation
- **External Agent Integration** - Seamless connection to remote A2A agents

## Why Hector's Architecture Matters

Hector's architecture enables:

- **Zero Code Development** - Define complete agent systems in YAML
- **True Interoperability** - A2A protocol ensures compatibility across platforms
- **Natural Scaling** - From single agents to complex multi-agent systems
- **Production Ready** - Built-in security, monitoring, and session management

This section provides the technical foundation for understanding how Hector works and why it's designed the way it is.
