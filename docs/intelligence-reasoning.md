# Intelligence & Reasoning

Control how your agents think, reason, and make decisions. These features determine the quality and reliability of your agent's responses.

## Core Features

- **[Prompt Customization](prompt-customization)** - Fine-tune agent behavior with slot-based prompts
- **[Reasoning Strategies](reasoning-strategies)** - Chain-of-thought vs supervisor reasoning
- **[Advanced Reasoning](advanced-reasoning)** - Reflection, verification, and goal extraction

## Quick Start

1. **Start with Prompt Customization** - Define your agent's personality and behavior
2. **Choose Reasoning Strategy** - Chain-of-thought for single agents, supervisor for multi-agent
3. **Add Advanced Features** - Enable reflection and verification for higher quality

## Key Concepts

- **Slot-based Prompts**: Fine-grained control without losing built-in reasoning
- **Reasoning Engines**: Different thinking patterns for different use cases
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in verification and reflection capabilities

This section covers the "brain" of your agents - how they think and reason about problems.
