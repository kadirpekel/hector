# Tools & Actions

Give your agents capabilities beyond language generation. Tools enable agents to interact with the world, execute commands, and perform actions.

## Core Features

- **[Built-in Tools](built-in-tools)** - 5 ready-to-use tools for common tasks
- **[MCP Integration](mcp-integration)** - Connect to 150+ external tools
- **[Custom Tools](custom-tools)** - Build custom capabilities via gRPC

## Quick Start

1. **Use Built-in Tools** - Start with the 5 core tools
2. **Connect External Tools** - Add MCP integrations
3. **Build Custom Tools** - Create domain-specific capabilities

## Key Concepts

- **Tool Registry**: Centralized discovery and execution
- **Security**: Whitelist-based access control
