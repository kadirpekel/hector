   # or
   go test ./...
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow Go conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run quality checks**
   ```bash
   make dev  # Runs fmt, vet, test, and build
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create a PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for custom reasoning strategies
fix: handle empty agent responses gracefully
docs: update API documentation
test: add integration tests for A2A protocol
```

## Code Standards

### Go Code Style

- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions focused and small

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test both success and error cases

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add package documentation for new packages
- Update API documentation for interface changes
- Include examples in documentation

## Areas for Contribution

### High Priority

- **A2A Protocol Compliance**: Ensure full compliance with the A2A specification
- **Documentation**: Improve guides, examples, and API docs
- **Testing**: Add more comprehensive tests
- **Performance**: Optimize agent execution and memory usage

### Medium Priority

- **New Tools**: Implement additional built-in tools
- **LLM Providers**: Add support for more LLM providers
- **Database Integrations**: Add more vector database options
- **Plugin System**: Enhance the gRPC plugin system

### Low Priority

- **UI/UX**: Web interface for agent management
- **Monitoring**: Metrics and observability
- **Security**: Enhanced security features

## Alpha Status Considerations

Since Hector is in alpha:

- **APIs may change** - We're still refining interfaces
- **Breaking changes** - Will be documented in release notes
- **Experimental features** - May be removed or modified
- **Feedback is valuable** - Your input helps shape the project

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or request features
- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask questions or discuss ideas
- **Documentation**: Check the [docs/](docs/) directory

## Release Process

Releases are managed through:

1. **Semantic Versioning**: We follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
2. **GitHub Releases**: Automated via GoReleaser
3. **Alpha Releases**: Pre-release versions for testing
