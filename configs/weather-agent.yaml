# Weather Agent - Demonstrates MCP tool integration
# 
# ⚠️  REQUIRES: MCP weather server running at ${MCP_WEATHER_SERVER}
# This is an EXAMPLE showing how to configure external MCP tools.
# Without a running MCP server, Hector will report it can't access weather data.

# Setup:
# ------
# 1. Start an MCP weather server at http://localhost:3000
#    (See: https://modelcontextprotocol.io for MCP server examples)
# 2. Set MCP_WEATHER_SERVER in your .env file
# 3. Run: hector --config configs/weather-agent.yaml
#
# Example queries:
# > "What's the weather in Tokyo? Should I bring an umbrella?"
# > "Compare weather in Paris, London, and Berlin - where should I vacation?"
# > "Is it hoodie weather in San Francisco right now?"
#
# Without MCP server: Hector will say it can't access real-time weather data.
# This config demonstrates MCP integration patterns for your own tools.
