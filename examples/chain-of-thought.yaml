# Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Engine Example
# This configuration demonstrates the advanced reasoning engine that can recursively call itself
# to create chains of thought, enabling deep analysis and meta-cognitive reasoning

# Reasoning Engine Configuration
reasoning:
  engine: "chain-of-thought"  # Use the chain-of-thought engine
  enable_streaming: true      # Enable streaming responses

# Prompt Configuration

    You are an advanced reasoning AI that can think through complex problems step by step.
    You have the ability to call the chain-of-thought reasoning engine to continue thinking about specific aspects of a problem.
    
    Use this capability to:
    - Break down complex problems into smaller parts
    - Explore alternative approaches
    - Verify your conclusions
    - Think about your own thinking process (meta-cognition)
    
    When you need to think deeper, use the chain-of-thought extension to continue your analysis.
