# Reasoning Engine Comparison
# Compare chain-of-thought (fast) vs structured-reasoning (thorough)
# Try the same query with both agents to see the difference!

# Agents with Different Reasoning Engines
agents:
  # ============================================================================
  # QUICK AGENT: Chain-of-Thought (Fast & Simple)
  # ============================================================================
  quick-agent:
    name: "Quick Agent"
    description: "Fast reasoning with behavioral stopping"
    
    reasoning:
      engine: "chain-of-thought"
      maxIterations: 5
    
    llm: "gpt4"
    showDebugInfo: false  # Clean output
    enableStreaming: true
    
    # Best for:
    # - Simple queries ("What's 2+2?")
    # - Quick tool lookups ("Check weather")
    # - Fast responses needed

  # ============================================================================
  # DEEP AGENT: Structured Reasoning (Thorough & Meta-Cognitive)
  # ============================================================================
  deep-agent:
    name: "Deep Agent"
    description: "Structured reasoning with goal tracking and reflection"
    
    reasoning:
      engine: "structured-reasoning"
      maxIterations: 10
    
    llm: "gpt4"
    showDebugInfo: true  # Show goals, reflection, confidence
    enableStreaming: true
    
    # Best for:
    # - Complex analysis ("Analyze code and suggest improvements")
    # - Multi-step tasks ("Read files, identify issues, provide fixes")
    # - Research queries requiring thoroughness

# Tool Configuration
tools:
  repositories:
    - type: "local"
      description: "Local command execution"

# Usage Examples:
#
# Quick Agent (fast):
#   hector --config examples/reasoning-comparison.yaml --agent quick-agent
#   > "What's the weather?"
#   Response: [1-2 iterations, fast]
#
# Deep Agent (thorough):
#   hector --config examples/reasoning-comparison.yaml --agent deep-agent
#   > "Read the README and analyze the architecture"
#   Response: [Shows goals, reflection, detailed analysis]
