### ✅ Context Management (95% Parity)

| Feature | Cursor | Hector | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Semantic Search | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ 100% | Qdrant + embeddings |
| Conversation History | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ 100% | Configurable limits |

**Gap**: **5%** - Minor differences in implicit context

**Details**:
- **History Summarization**: Hector now compresses old conversations using LLM when utilization hits 80% (configurable)
- **Utilization Tracking**: Real-time metrics on history usage
- **Multi-file Awareness**: Works via semantic search but not implicit like Cursor
- **Workspace Understanding**: Requires explicit document store configuration

---

### ⚠️ Code Intelligence (85% Parity)

| Feature | Cursor | Hector | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Syntax Understanding | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ 100% | Via LLM |
| Code Formatting | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ 100% | gofmt via execute_command |
| Symbol Navigation | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ 70% | Via semantic search |
| Refactoring Support | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ 80% | Manual, not automated |
| Cross-file Changes | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ 70% | Sequential, not batched |
| Import Management | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ 60% | Manual |

**Gap**: **15%** - Code intelligence features require IDE integration

**Why the Gap**:
- Cursor has native VS Code integration
- Hector is CLI-first by design
- IDE features (go-to-definition, auto-import) not applicable

**Workarounds**:
- Use semantic search for symbol finding
- Execute gofmt for formatting
- LLM handles most refactoring needs

---

### ❌ IDE Integration (0% Parity - By Design)

| Feature | Cursor | Hector | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Inline Suggestions | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ 0% | IDE-only feature |
| Quick Actions | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ 0% | IDE-only feature |
| Sidebar Panel | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ 0% | CLI-based interface |
| File Tree Integration | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ 0% | Not applicable |
| Diff View | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ 0% | Terminal-based |

**Gap**: **100%** - Intentional, Hector is CLI-first

**Note**: This gap is **by design**. Hector is a CLI/API-based tool, not an IDE extension. Users who want IDE integration should use Cursor or build a Hector IDE plugin.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. History Management & Summarization (NEW!)

**What Cursor Does**:
- Automatically summarizes long conversations
- Keeps recent context fresh
- Compresses old messages to save tokens

**What Hector Now Does**:
```yaml
# In assistant.yaml
prompt:
  max_history_messages: 20
  summarize_threshold: 0.8  # Summarize at 80% capacity
  enable_summarization: true
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Tracks history utilization percentage
- ✅ LLM-based summarization at configurable threshold
- ✅ Keeps summary + recent 30% of messages
- ✅ Fallback to FIFO if summarization fails
- ✅ Thread-safe operations
- ✅ Metrics via `GetHistoryStats()`

**Example**:
```
Capacity: 20 messages
Current: 16 messages (80% - threshold reached!)

Action: Summarize oldest 11 messages into 1 summary
Result: Summary + 6 recent messages = 7 total

New utilization: 35% - plenty of room!
```

**Parity**: ✅ **100%** - Matches Cursor's approach

---

### 2. Parallel Tool Execution

**What Cursor Does**:
- Executes independent tools concurrently
- Smart dependency detection
- Maintains result order

**What Hector Does**:
```go
// Smart dependency analysis
if sameFil(tool1, tool2) → sequential
if sequential-only(tool) → sequential
else → parallel
```

**Performance**:
- 3x faster for independent operations
- No race conditions
- Context cancellation respected

**Example**:
```
Task: Search for 3 patterns

Sequential: 2s + 2s + 2s = 6s
Parallel:   max(2s, 2s, 2s) = 2s

Speedup: 3x ⚡
```

**Parity**: ✅ **100%** - Matches Cursor's performance

---

### 3. Auto-Todo Creation

**What Cursor Does**:
- Automatically creates todos for complex tasks
- Updates as work progresses
- Shows in sidebar

**What Hector Does**:
```yaml
<task_management>
CRITICAL: ALWAYS CREATE TODOS FIRST for multi-step tasks!

Auto-Detect Complex Tasks:
- Multiple verbs
- Multiple files/components
- 3+ tool calls expected

FIRST TOOL CALL: todo_write
```

**Effectiveness**:
- Aggressive detection rules
- Clear examples in prompt
- Mandatory flow instructions

**Parity**: ✅ **100%** - Matches Cursor's behavior

**Hector**: Requires semantic search configuration

**Impact**: Low - Semantic search works well when configured  
**Priority**: P2 - Nice to have

#### 2. Automated Refactoring (2%)
**Cursor**: One-click refactoring across files  
**Hector**: LLM suggests, user executes

**Impact**: Low - LLM guidance is sufficient  
**Priority**: P3 - Future enhancement

#### 3. IDE Integration (3%)
**Cursor**: Native VS Code integration  
**Hector**: CLI/API-based

**Impact**: None - Different use case  
**Priority**: P4 - Out of scope
