# Hector Self-Development System

## 🤖 Hector Developing Hector

This package enables Hector to autonomously improve itself through multi-agent workflows, comprehensive benchmarking, and learning from past improvements.

## 🎯 Vision

**Recursive Self-Improvement**: Hector analyzes its own codebase, identifies improvements, implements changes, validates through rigorous testing, and commits successful enhancements - all autonomously with human oversight.

## 📊 How It Works

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SELF-IMPROVEMENT CYCLE                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. 📖 LEARN FROM HISTORY
   │
   ├─ Load recent dev commits
   ├─ Analyze success/failure patterns
   ├─ Generate insights and recommendations
   └─ Identify focus areas

2. 🔍 ANALYZE CODEBASE
   │
   ├─ Code Analyzer Agent examines code

   └─ Plans testing strategy

4. ⚙️  IMPLEMENT CHANGES
   │
   ├─ Implementer Agent writes code
   ├─ Follows best practices
   ├─ Maintains code quality
   └─ Ensures robustness

5. 🧪 TEST & BENCHMARK
   │
   ├─ Tester Agent runs all tests

   └─ Compares before/after metrics

6. ✅ REVIEW & VALIDATE
   │
   ├─ Reviewer Agent performs final check
   ├─ Verifies improvements > 5%
   ├─ Ensures no regressions
   └─ Makes go/no-go decision

7. 💾 COMMIT & LEARN
   │
   ├─ Git Manager creates dev branch
   ├─ Commits with detailed KPI data
   ├─ Pushes for human review
   └─ Stores learnings for future cycles

   ↓ (If approved, merge to main)
   
8. 🔄 REPEAT
   └─ Cycle continues with accumulated knowledge
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Run Full Self-Improvement Cycle

```bash
# Run the complete autonomous improvement workflow
echo "Analyze the codebase and propose improvements focusing on performance" | \
  ./hector --config hector-dev.yaml --workflow self-improvement
```

### Run Benchmarks Only

```bash
# Run comprehensive KPI benchmarks
go run dev/cmd/benchmark/main.go

# Save to file
go run dev/cmd/benchmark/main.go --output kpis-baseline.json
```

### Compare KPIs

```bash
# Compare two KPI snapshots
go run dev/cmd/compare/main.go \
  --before kpis-baseline.json \
  --after kpis-current.json
```

### Analyze Development History

```bash
# View learnings from past improvements
go run dev/cmd/memory/main.go --commits 50
```

## 🛠️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`kpis.go`** - KPI definitions, comparison, and tracking
2. **`benchmarks.go`** - Comprehensive benchmark suite
3. **`git_manager.go`** - Git operations and branch management
4. **`memory.go`** - Learning from commit history
5. **`hector-dev.yaml`** - Multi-agent self-dev workflow

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Role | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Code Analyzer** | Find opportunities | Identify high-impact improvements |
| **Architect** | Design solution | Validate approach, plan implementation |
| **Implementer** | Write code | Implement changes with quality |
| **Tester** | Validate | Run tests, benchmarks, measure KPIs |
| **Reviewer** | Quality gate | Final review, go/no-go decision |
| **Git Manager** | Version control | Create branches, commit with KPIs |

## 📝 Commit Message Format

- ✅ Requires explicit merge approval
- ✅ Full audit trail in commits
- ✅ Easy rollback
- ✅ Never pushes to main automatically

**Guardrails**:

- Tests must pass before commit
- Minimum improvement threshold (5%)
- Maximum iteration limit
- Timeout protection
- Sandboxed tool execution
